# ‚öõÔ∏è React Resize Detector Context

![Demo GIF](/doc/assets/demo.gif)

A lightweight React context that leverages [react-resize-detector](https://github.com/maslianok/react-resize-detector) to dynamically detect the
current breakpoint based on an element's width. It provides utility functions and helper components to conditionally render content based on
responsive breakpoints ‚Äì all fully typed in TypeScript for excellent IDE support. üòé

## Features ‚ú®

- **Responsive Breakpoint Detection:** Dynamically calculates the active breakpoint from an element‚Äôs width.
- **Custom Breakpoints:** Define standard breakpoints like "XS", "SM", "MD", "LG", "XL" or any custom names (e.g. "Smart", "Mini", etc.).
- **Utility Methods:**
    - `isAtLeast(breakpoint)`: Returns `true` if the active breakpoint is greater than or equal to the specified breakpoint.
    - `isBelow(breakpoint)`: Returns `true` if the active breakpoint is lower than the specified breakpoint.
    - `valueByBreakpoint(mapping)`: Retrieves a value from a mapping object based on the active breakpoint.
- **Conditional Rendering:** The `BreakpointConditional` component conditionally renders content based on breakpoint conditions.
- **Full TypeScript Support:** Enjoy robust type definitions and IDE hints for a seamless development experience.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Wrap your component tree with the `BreakpointProvider` and supply your breakpoint configuration. Then, use the `useBreakpoint` hook to access context
values.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { BreakpointProvider, useBreakpoint } from 'my-breakpoint-package';

const breakpoints = {
  XS: 0,
  SM: 500,
  MD: 700,
  LG: 900,
  XL: 1100,
};

const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const { width, breakpoint, isAtLeast, valueByBreakpoint } = useBreakpoint();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current width: {width}px</p>
  <p>Active breakpoint: {breakpoint}</p>
  <p>Is at least MD: {isAtLeast('MD') ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå'}</p>
  <p>
  Mapping: {valueByBreakpoint({
    XS: 'Extra Small',
    SM: 'Small',
    MD: 'Medium',
    LG: 'Large',
    XL: 'Extra Large'
  })}
  </p>
  </div>
);
};

const App = () => (
  <BreakpointProvider breakpoints={breakpoints}>
    <ResponsiveComponent />
    </BreakpointProvider>
);

export default App;
```

---

### Conditional Rendering with BreakpointConditional

Render content only when specific breakpoint conditions are met.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { BreakpointProvider, BreakpointConditional } from 'my-breakpoint-package';

const breakpoints = {
  XS: 0,
  SM: 500,
  MD: 700,
  LG: 900,
  XL: 1100,
};

const ConditionalComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <BreakpointConditional isAtLeast="MD">
    <p>üòä This content is visible from MD and up.</p>
</BreakpointConditional>
<BreakpointConditional isBelow="LG">
  <p>üöÄ This content is visible for breakpoints below LG.</p>
</BreakpointConditional>
</div>
);

const App = () => (
  <BreakpointProvider breakpoints={breakpoints}>
    <ConditionalComponent />
    </BreakpointProvider>
);

export default App;
```

---

### Custom Breakpoints Example

Define your own custom breakpoints ‚Äì for example, using car sizes:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { BreakpointProvider, useBreakpoint } from 'my-breakpoint-package';

const carBreakpoints = {
  Smart: 0,
  Mini: 350,
  Sedan: 600,
  SUV: 900,
  Ram: 1200,
};

const CarComponent = () => {
  const { width, breakpoint, valueByBreakpoint } = useBreakpoint();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current width: {width}px</p>
  <p>Active car size: {breakpoint}</p>
  <p>
  Mapping: {valueByBreakpoint({
    Smart: 'üöó Smart',
    Mini: 'üöô Mini',
    Sedan: 'üöò Sedan',
    SUV: 'üöê SUV',
    Ram: 'üöö Ram'
  })}
  </p>
  </div>
);
};

const App = () => ( <BreakpointProvider breakpoints={carBreakpoints}>
      <CarComponent /> 
    </BreakpointProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## API Documentation

### BreakpointProvider

The `BreakpointProvider` sets up the responsive context by measuring the width of an element and determining the active breakpoint based on the
provided configuration.

| Property    | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                                                               | Default                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| breakpoints | `Record<Breakpoint, number>`                  | An object defining your breakpoints. The keys are the breakpoint names (e.g., "XS", "SM", "MD", etc.), and the values are the minimum widths (in pixels). | **Required**             |
| children    | `React.ReactNode`                             | Child components that consume the breakpoint context.                                                                                                     | **Required**             |
| targetRef   | `{ current: HTMLElement \| null }` (optional) | A reference to the element whose width is observed. If not provided, an internal `<div>` is rendered to attach the ref.                                   | Internal `<div>` is used |

**Notes:**

- If the measured width is `undefined` or `0`, an error is logged in the console.
- If duplicate breakpoint values are detected, a warning is logged.

### BreakpointConditional

The `BreakpointConditional` component conditionally renders its children based on the active breakpoint.

| Property  | Type              | Description                                                                                                      | Default      |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| show      | `Breakpoint[]`    | An array of breakpoint names. The children are rendered only if the active breakpoint is included in this array. | Not set      |
| isAtLeast | `Breakpoint`      | The children are rendered only if the active breakpoint is greater than or equal to this value.                  | Not set      |
| isBelow   | `Breakpoint`      | The children are rendered only if the active breakpoint is lower than this value.                                | Not set      |
| children  | `React.ReactNode` | The content to render if the condition is met.                                                                   | **Required** |

*Note:* Multiple conditions can be combined; all specified conditions must be met for the children to render.

### useBreakpoint Hook

The `useBreakpoint` hook provides access to the responsive context. It returns an object with the following properties and methods:

| Property/Method                                                                  | Type                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                      |

| **breakpoint**                                                                   | `Breakpoint \| null`                                            | The active breakpoint based on the current width. Returns `null` if no breakpoint is determined or if width is undefined.                        |
| **breakpoints**                                                                  | `Record<Breakpoint, number>`                                    | The breakpoint configuration provided to the `BreakpointProvider`.                                                                               |
| **isAtLeast(breakpoint: Breakpoint): boolean**                                   | `(breakpoint: Breakpoint) => boolean`                           | Returns `true` if the active breakpoint is greater than or equal to the specified breakpoint.                                                    |
| **isBelow(breakpoint: Breakpoint): boolean**                                     | `(breakpoint: Breakpoint) => boolean`                           | Returns `true` if the active breakpoint is lower than the specified breakpoint.                                                                  |
| **valueByBreakpoint<T>(values: Partial<Record<Breakpoint, T>>): T \| undefined** | `<T>(values: Partial<Record<Breakpoint, T>>) => T \| undefined` | Returns a value from the provided mapping based on the active breakpoint. If no value is mapped for the current breakpoint, returns `undefined`. |

#### Example Usage of `useBreakpoint`

```typescript
import React from 'react';

  LG: 900,
  XL: 1100,
};

const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const { width, breakpoint, isAtLeast, valueByBreakpoint } = useBreakpoint();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current width: {width}px</p>
  <p>Active breakpoint: {breakpoint}</p>
  <p>Is at least MD: {isAtLeast('MD') ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå'}</p>
  <p>
