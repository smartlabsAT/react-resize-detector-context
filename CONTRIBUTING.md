## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Ensure proper typing (avoid `any` when possible)
- Follow the existing code style

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components focused and composable

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for high test coverage

### Comments and Documentation

- Document breaking changes

## Commit Messages

We use conventional commits. Please follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(provider): add devMode prop for console logging control

Added optional devMode prop to BreakpointProvider to control when
console errors are displayed. Defaults to NODE_ENV !== 'production'.
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers using:
```bash
pnpm release
```

This will:
1. Build the package
2. Update version
3. Create git tag
4. Push to GitHub
5. Create GitHub release
6. Publish to npm (if configured)

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with your question or reach out to the maintainers.
